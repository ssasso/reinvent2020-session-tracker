Many of these industries deal with huge metal surfaces that are subject to corrosion, which poses a serious risk and huge financial impact. This demonstration showcases a machine learning approach to corrosion detection that helps visualize corroded areas. Learn how AWS Step Functions is used to create Amazon SageMaker machine learning models and deploy them for inference within a web application built with AWS Amplify and Amazon CloudFront.",

The inspection outputs are then used in business intelligence for issue monitoring, analytics, and forecasting for better decision-making processes.

When questions aren’t answered by existing BI dashboards, users rely on thinly staffed BI teams to get answers, which typically takes days or weeks. With QuickSight Q, which uses natural language processing and semantic data understanding techniques, users can simply type their question (e.g., “What is the year-over-year sales trend?”) and get an answer in seconds. It extracts business terminology and intent, retrieves the corresponding data, and returns answers in the form of a number, chart, or table. Q makes it easy to get answers instantly, while freeing BI teams to focus on their core projects. This session introduces Q and demonstrates how to use it.<br></div>",

In Part 1 of this two-part session, see how modeling with DynamoDB is different than a traditional relational database, and learn some foundational elements of data modeling with DynamoDB.</div></div></div>",

To avoid this, you perform maintenance at regular intervals, which is inefficient and increases your maintenance costs. Predictive maintenance allows you to plan the required repair at an optimal time before a breakdown occurs. However, predictive maintenance solutions can be challenging and costly to implement given the high costs and complexity of sensors and infrastructure. You also have to deal with the challenges of interpreting sensor data and accurately detecting faults in order to send alerts. Come learn how Amazon Monitron helps you solve these challenges by offering an out-of-the-box, end-to-end, cost-effective system.</div>",

During a replatform of its online sales platform, Dunelm chose to build a completely serverless microservices application. Hear the story of how DuneIm moved to deploying changes over 200 times a month and saw an average speed improvement of 472 percent across its entire platform. In addition, hear how it has decided to organize teams around core business domains, and see how observability is a core component of moving fast with serverless.

Faster software development lifecycles (SDLCs) have made supporting and securing applications more difficult. But the good news is that data can bridge the gap. In this session, hear how tech-enabled enterprises are leveraging tool-chain telemetry to break down data silos and create true visibility across the entire SDLC.

Now that tech-enabled enterprises have discovered how to release code faster, they’ve inadvertently introduced new problems with bugs, vulnerabilities, and stack visibility problems. Faster software development lifecycles (SDLCs) have made supporting and securing applications more difficult. But the good news is that data can bridge the gap. In this session, hear how tech-enabled enterprises are leveraging tool-chain telemetry to break down data silos and create true visibility across the entire SDLC. Learn how the power of code-to-cloud visibility is that it helps teams keep up with release velocity and build better and more secure applications.

Now that tech-enabled enterprises have discovered how to release code faster, they’ve inadvertently introduced new problems with bugs, vulnerabilities, and stack visibility problems. Faster software development lifecycles (SDLCs) have made supporting and securing applications more difficult. But the good news is that data can bridge the gap. In this session, hear how tech-enabled enterprises are leveraging tool-chain telemetry to break down data silos and create true visibility across the entire SDLC. Learn how the power of code-to-cloud visibility is that it helps teams keep up with release velocity and build better and more secure applications.

These interactions sometimes have unpredictable behaviors caused by unforeseen turbulent events (e.g., a network failure) that can turn benign issues into catastrophic failures. Such events can be minimized with chaos engineering, a discipline that helps gain confidence in the system’s resilience to failures. This session presents an open-source approach to failure injection on Amazon EC2 and Amazon ECS using AWS Systems Manager and discusses how Prime Video combines this approach with load testing for higher levels of resiliency.</div>",

These interactions sometimes have unpredictable behaviors caused by unforeseen turbulent events (e.g., a network failure) that can turn benign issues into catastrophic failures. Such events can be minimized with chaos engineering, a discipline that helps gain confidence in the system’s resilience to failures. This session presents an open-source approach to failure injection on Amazon EC2 and Amazon ECS using AWS Systems Manager and discusses how Prime Video combines this approach with load testing for higher levels of resiliency.</div>",

The session also reviews how RoS uses S3 Object Versioning, MFA Delete, and replication to ensure that documents are retained indefinitely in a more secure, auditable, and durable manner than previously possible. Finally, you learn how RoS is accelerating its registration processes by making deeds available as text with Amazon Textract.</div></div>",

This session dives deep into how AWS generates smart query plans in the absence of accurate table statistics. It also covers adaptive query execution—a technique to dynamically collect statistics during query execution—and how AWS uses dynamic partition pruning to generate query predicates for speeding up table joins. You also learn about execution improvements such as data prefetching and pruning of nested data types.",

This session dives deep into how AWS generates smart query plans in the absence of accurate table statistics. It also covers adaptive query execution—a technique to dynamically collect statistics during query execution—and how AWS uses dynamic partition pruning to generate query predicates for speeding up table joins. You also learn about execution improvements such as data prefetching and pruning of nested data types.",
